## About me

I'm a theoretical physicist and Assistant Professor at the Decision 
Analysis and Support Unit, Warsaw School of Economics (Poland), where 
I've established myself as a specialist in graph theory. 
With a strong background in creating new variables based on community structures, I've 
applied my expertise to various business domains, leveraging the power 
of graph analysis for data-driven insights.

In addition to my research focus, I possess extensive experience with 
data analysis using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning 
(DL) models, both in batch mode and real-time processing. 
This expertise has enabled me to develop efficient solutions for a range of 
applications.

As an MLOps professional, I play a critical role in ensuring the smooth 
deployment of model solutions in cloud environments. 
My responsibilities include code verification, testing, and validation to guarantee the 
performance and reliability of our models.

One area that particularly excites me is the intersection of physics and 
machine learning, where I'm exploring the potential of quantum machine 
learning. 
By combining my knowledge of physics with modern technologies, I aim to unlock new applications and breakthroughs in this emerging field.

Throughout my career, I've developed a strong passion for creating 
innovative solutions that drive meaningful impact. I'm committed to 
staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies and collaborating 
with like-minded professionals to push the boundaries of what's 
possible
