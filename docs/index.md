He is currently a theoretical physicist, an assistant professor at the Department of Statistical Methods and Business Analysis at SGH Warsaw School of Economics (Poland). He is a  QPoland member. The focus of his research are Real-Time analytics, Quantum Machine Learning, mathematical physics, in particular symmetries in neutrino physics and geometry, topology and Category Theory in Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Computing. His latest publications center around the flavour problem in the field of neutrino physics and feature selection methods in predictive models. With Piotr Sulkowski and Joanna Sulkowska they are trying to characterize RNA and protein structures by their topological characteristics called genus. The results of this work you can see on web serwer GENUS.
